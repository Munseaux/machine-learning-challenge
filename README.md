Overall the deep learning model did a bit better than the SVG, and it was easier to make and impliment. 

Deep learning had an accuracy of .90 and the SVG only managed .87. This was the case even when the models were construted and trained multiple times. 

Many models should be used in conjunction to find exoplanets. Both of these models are viable to a certian extent, but the best way to continue to find exoplanets is to include many other machine learning models in conjunction. Their findings should be reviewed by humans, and the most promising (where the different models agree) should be fast-tracked for study.
